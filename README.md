# Match 'Em UX Design Based on DeSo Application

Match 'Em aims to promote human connection by encouraging users to meet a person with a unique trait in the day. Each day provides a new prompt describing a type of person to take a picture with. This GitHub repository utilizes TypeScript to write to the DeSo blockchain and implements DeSo identity by accessing a user's DeSo account.
